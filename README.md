# Accuracy-and-Misclassification
The day/night image dataset consists of 200 RGB color images in two categories: day and night. There are equal numbers of each example: 100 day images and 100 night images.  We'd like to build a classifier that can accurately label these images as day or night, and that relies on finding distinguishing features between the two types of images!  Note: All images come from the AMOS dataset (Archive of Many Outdoor Scenes).
